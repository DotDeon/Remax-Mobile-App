# Remax Infoglobe Mobile Application in Flutter

This mobile application is designed to help real estate agents with their day-to-day inspections of properties. Built using Flutter, this app was my very first experience with the framework when it was first launched.

Features
Allows agents to take photos of the property and attach them to a report
Provides an easy-to-use interface for creating inspection reports
Enables agents to easily add comments and notes to their reports
Once a listing has been updated, send the agent an email
Installation
To install the app, follow these steps:

Clone the app from the GitHub repository: git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name
Install dependencies: flutter pub get
Run the app: flutter run
Usage
Once the app is running, you can use it to create inspection reports. Here's how:

Take photos of the property you're inspecting
Use the interface to add comments and notes about the property


**Note:** This application was used by Remax Infoglobe for a period of time before the head office purchased a license for another software that all the branches now use. As a result, this app is no longer actively maintained or used. I am sharing this code on GitHub for educational purposes only and do not recommend using it for any production purposes. Please keep this in mind when exploring the code and its features.
